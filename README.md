## Project 1 : JPEG Compression
JPEG compression to four given grayscale images and observation on the changes in
frequency domain.

## Project 3 : Action Recognition with Optical Flow
In this assignment, goal is classifying the action in a given video. In this link
(http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/SpaceTimeActions.html) you can download the dataset you will
be working on. Note that you need to download all of the classes in the Classification Database. On this
dataset, you will be applying HOOF [1] (Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow), PCA (Principal Component
Analysis) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for classification.
